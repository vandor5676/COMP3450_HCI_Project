<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>
<h3 align="center">This website is the final project submission for COMP 3450: Human Computer Interation <br> instructed by Aras Balali Moghaddam</h3>
<h4 align="center">Our application idea is intended to bring local vendors online to one cohesive platform.
This would allow locals to have fresh produce, animal products, artisan products, and
more delivered right to their door.

<p align="center">While farmerâ€™s markets are traditionally a seasonal community event, where locals can gather to buy a variety of goods, many people prefer digital interaction due to their schedules and other factors. This is especially important with the fast-changing global situation. Kamloops Virtual Marketplace brings this cherished community event online, where fresh local products can be accessible anytime of year. Some vendors may be far from city limits or out of the way for most buyers. This service aims to close the gap between producers and consumers, making it easier than ever to support local businesses while promoting a more sustainable economic trend within the community of Kamloops.
